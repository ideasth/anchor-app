// Regression test for the deploy that rolled back when Stage 17 first
// shipped: `router.get("/assets/*", ...)` is Express-4 syntax and throws at
// router-construction time under Express 5 / path-to-regexp 8.
//
// This test imports both new routers and asserts that constructing them does
// not throw.  If anyone reintroduces a bare-`*` route pattern or any other
// Express-4 form, this test fails fast — long before pm2 has to roll back.
