## 2026-05-08 — Cross-thread continuity setup (Option B)

**What happened**
- Set up `github.com/ideasth/anchor-app` (private) as the source-of-truth repo so any thread in the Life Management space can clone, build, and publish.
- Updated `CONTEXT.md` and the space's Instructions block with a bootstrap step (recreate `.secrets/anchor_sync_secret`) and a clone step (`gh repo clone ideasth/anchor-app /home/user/workspace/anchor`).
- Initial commit `23903ea` contains the calendar bug fix (CalendarPlanner.tsx — added `couple` key to `COL_DEFS` plus defensive guards) and is ready to publish.

**Calendar bug — fix is in the repo, not yet on live**
- File: `client/src/pages/CalendarPlanner.tsx`
- Fix: added `{ key: "couple", label: "Couple", group: "couple" }` to `COL_DEFS` and defensive guards for `dayMap[col]` and `dayMap.family_notes`.
- Built bundle in last thread: `dist/public/assets/index-OJD7pA68.js`. New threads should rebuild fresh.
- **Action for next thread**: open a new thread, clone+build+publish to push the fix to `https://anchor-jod.pplx.app`. The "Website publishing is not enabled" error in the previous thread was a cached capability check; new threads should not hit it.

**Outstanding decisions (non-blocking)**
1. Family email addresses for cron `f04511c0` priority filter — only Marieke confirmed so far. Other family senders TBD.
2. Epworth treatment emails — always priority / never / only if direct? TBD.

**Cron status (latest verified runs)**
- `a6c5cc04` (Outlook + capture bridge): run #24 at 06:49 AEST 2026-05-08, ok=true. State at `/home/user/workspace/anchor-cron-state/seen.json` (outlook=154, capture=0). Note: this state file is NOT in the repo and resets per thread.
- `f04511c0` (email status pull): ran successfully at 06:03 AEST 2026-05-08 with 0 priority emails. Cron prompt has verified Outlook connector syntax (`in:sent` returns thread_id = conversationId for O(1) reply detection) baked into the latest cron body.
- `33d5581b` + `51e88e18` (calendar): ran successfully overnight.

**Diagnostic ticket open**
- `9a2f2c0a-7c54-4eb2-a1df-cd53f7823aac` — `publish_website` returned "Website publishing is not enabled" repeatedly in cached threads. Workaround: open a new thread.

**What does NOT travel between threads (be aware)**
- `data.db` — production DB lives on the deployed sandbox; threads start empty unless they pull from the API.
- `/home/user/workspace/anchor-cron-state/seen.json` — FIFO dedup state for cron `a6c5cc04`. Resets per thread.
- `/home/user/workspace/anchor-cron-state/sent_style_sample.json` — TTL 24h style cache for cron `f04511c0`. Re-fetched on next run.
- `/home/user/workspace/cron_tracking/` — per-cron tracking files. Local only.
- `server/baked-secret.ts` — gitignored; regenerated at publish time from `.secrets/anchor_sync_secret`.
